# matchstick

This is a project from the Basic C Programming module of my first year.

The task was to recreate a terminal version of the NIM/Marienbad game (https://www.archimedes-lab.org/game_nim/nim.html#)

Build using Makefile.

USAGE: ./matchstick number_of_lines number_of_matches_to_take
number_of_lines := an integer between 2 and 99 describing the playing field
number_of_matches_to_take := an integer describing the maximum amount of matches that can be taken
